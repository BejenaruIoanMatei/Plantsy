## My Plan

There is not dataset specifically for the flowers in Romania so i am going to create my own dataset.
(there are a few for plant recognition and for a few flowers in UK and well known ones such as roses and irises, but for the sake of learning i will try and create my own)

## Classes (10)
- Trandafir (Rosa)
- Margareta (Leucanthemum vulgare)
- Lalea (Tulipa)
- Floarea-soarelui (Helianthus annuus)
- Lavandă (Lavandula)
- Crin (Lilium)
- Mac (Papaver rhoeas)
- Iris (Iris)
- Ghiocelul (Galanthus nivalis)
- Toporaș (Viola odorata)

In total there are 10 classes (types of flowers) and for every class i will collect around 120-230 images from different sources on the internet (i am not a great photographer so i wont be taking any photos)

For better results i plan to use: **Data Augmentation**
