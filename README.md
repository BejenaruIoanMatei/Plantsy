This project aims to develop a deep learning model for flower recognition. The goal is to create a model capable of accurately identifying different flower species based on images.

### Objectives
- Creating my own dataset with 10 of the most popular flowers in Romania
- Building a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using TensorFlow
- Fine-tuning the model to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting
- Implementing Data Augmentation techniques for better generalization

### Tech Stack
- Python
  - Tensorflow
  - Flask
